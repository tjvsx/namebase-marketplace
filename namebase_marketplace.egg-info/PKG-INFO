Python 3.6+ client for interacting with Namebase Marketplace API.

## Usage
Instantiating the Marketplace object can be done either by using email and password or None.
Only post requests can be made authenticated.

Websocket API is not provided.
## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or greater

### Install

> pip install namebase-marketplace

### Usage

##### Core REST API for Namebase MARKETPLACE
```python
from namebase_marketplace.marketplace import *
marketplace = Marketplace(email="YOUR EMAIL", pwd="YOUR PASSWORD")
marketplace.get_user_info()
marketplace.open_bid(domain='domain', bid_amount=0.4, blind_amount=100)
```

##### EXAMPLE WITHOUT AUTHENTICATION:
```python
from namebase_marketplace.marketplace import *
marketplace = Marketplace()
marketplace.get_marketplace_domains(offset=100) # Get 101-200 latest marketplace domains with default options
```

  
On some endpoints you can pass options, please refer them to the following documentation: https://github.com/namebasehq/api-documentation/blob/master/marketplace-api.md

### Github OAuth bypass and 2FA Auth Bypass
You can bypass these restrictions to use this library by replacing the following code on your namebase_marketplace package and marketplace class:
  
  ```python
   self.cookies = { "namebase-main": "s:lF21222EXX2323c-EXAMPLE.THIS_IS_AN_EXAMPLE++121HRYL/23+42c/12hOEEXAMPLE223" } 
```
  
  This is the cookie Namebase uses to auth you within the app. You can find this cookie when reloading any page and going to Network on Inspection Mode. Head to a request and find this cookie under "Cookies" tab on any explorer along with other kind of cookies.

  
### Donations

I have made this library open-sourced and free to use. However, if you consider this library has helped you, or you just want to sponsor me, donations are welcomed to one of my HANDSHAKE addresses.
